Your guild might be a large merchant consortium (or family) with interests across the region. Perhaps you transported goods from one place to another, by ship, wagon, or caravan, or bought them from traveling traders and sold them in your own little shop.

You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the<span> Druid table.</span></p>\r\n<h5>Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p>The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&rsquo;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish<span> a long rest.</span></p>\r\n<p>You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have<span> spell slots.</span></p>\r\n<p>For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span>cure wounds, </span>you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn&rsquo;t remove it from your list of pre<span>pared spells.</span></p>\r\n<p>You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell <span>on your list.</span></p>\r\n<h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\r\n<h5>Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p>You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the sp<span>ell prepared.</span></p>\r\n<h5>Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p>You can use a druidic focus (see the <span style=\"color:#47d18c\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#DruidicFocus\" rel=\"nofollow\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your <span>druid spells.</span></p>","requiredLevel":1,"displayOrder":4},{"id":167,"name":"Wild Shape","prerequisite":null,"description":"<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before.

You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit po<span>ints, or die.</span></p>\r\n<p>While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature&rsquo;s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can&rsquo;t use them.</li>\r\n<li>When you transform, you assume the beast&rsquo;s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn&rsquo;t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren&rsquo;t knocked unconscious.</li>\r\n<li>You can&rsquo;t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn&rsquo;t break your concentration on a spell you&rsquo;ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <span>call lightning</span>, that you&rsquo;ve already cast.</li>\r\n<li>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can&rsquo;t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\r\n<li>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature&rsquo;s shape and size. Your equipment doesn&rsquo;t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can&rsquo;t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it.

When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn&rsquo;t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren&rsquo;t knocked unconscious.</li>\r\n<li>You can&rsquo;t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn&rsquo;t break your concentration on a spell you&rsquo;ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <span>call lightning</span>, that you&rsquo;ve already cast.</li>\r\n<li>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can&rsquo;t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\r\n<li>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature&rsquo;s shape and size. Your equipment doesn&rsquo;t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can&rsquo;t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it.

You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the <span>Cleric table.</span></p>\r\n<h5>Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p>The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&rsquo;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish<span> a long rest.</span></p>\r\n<p>You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list.

With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span>cure wounds</span>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn&rsquo;t remove it from your list of pre<span>pared spells.</span></p>\r\n<p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell <span>on your list.</span></p>\r\n<h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability.

You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall [condition]unconscious[/condition], drop to 0 hit po<span>ints, or die.</span></p>\r\n<p>While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature&rsquo;s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can&rsquo;t use them.</li>\r\n<li>When you transform, you assume the beast&rsquo;s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn&rsquo;t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren&rsquo;t knocked [condition]unconscious[/condition].</li>\r\n<li>You can&rsquo;t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn&rsquo;t break your concentration on a spell you&rsquo;ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as [spell]<span>call lightning[/spell]</span>, that you&rsquo;ve already cast.</li>\r\n<li>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can&rsquo;t use any of your special senses, such as [sense]darkvision[/sense], unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\r\n<li>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature&rsquo;s shape and size. Your equipment doesn&rsquo;t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can&rsquo;t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>\r\n</ul>","snippet":"As an action, you can magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before twice per short rest.

If your background is as an agent for one of the main factions of the North and Sword Coast, here are some poss<span>ibilities.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>The </span><span>Harpers:&nbsp;</span></strong>Founded more than a millennium ago, disbanded and reorganized several times, the Harpers remain a powerful, behind-the-scenes agency, which acts to thwart evil and promote fairness through knowledge, rather than brute force. Harper agents are often proficient in Investigation, enabling them to be adept at snooping and spying. They often seek aid from other Harpers, sympathetic bards and innkeepers, rangers, and the clergy of gods that are aligned with the Harper<span>s&rsquo; ideals.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>The </span></strong><span><strong>Order of the Gauntlet:</strong>&nbsp;</span>One of the newest power groups in Faer&ucirc;n, the Order of the Gauntlet has an agenda similar to that of the Harpers. Its methods are vastly different, however: bearers of the gauntlet are holy warriors on a righteous quest to crush evil and promote justice, and they never hide in the shadows. Order agents tend to be proficient in Religion, and frequently seek aid from law enforcement friendly to the order&rsquo;s ideals, and the clergy of the order&rsquo;s pa<span>tron gods.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>The </span></strong><span><strong>Emerald Enclave:</strong>&nbsp;</span>Maintaining balance in the natural order and combating the forces that threaten that balance is the twofold goal of the Emerald Enclave. Those who serve the faction are masters of survival and living off the land. They are often proficient in Nature, and can seek assistance from woodsmen, hunters, rangers, barbarian tribes, druid circles, and priests who revere the gods <span>of nature.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>The </span></strong><span><strong>Lords&rsquo; Alliance:</strong>&nbsp;</span>On one level, the agents of the Lords&rsquo; Alliance are representatives of the cities and other governments that constitute the alliance. But, as a faction with interests and concerns that transcend local politics and geography, the Alliance has its own cadre of individuals who work on behalf of the organizations, wider agenda. Alliance agents are required to be knowledgeable in History, and can always rely on the aid of the governments that are part of the Alliance, plus other leaders and groups who uphold the Alliance<span>&rsquo;s ideals.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>The </span></strong><span><strong>Zhentarim:</strong>&nbsp;</span>In recent years, the Zhentarim have become more visible in the world at large, as the group works to improve its reputation among the common people. The faction draws employees and associates from many walks of life, setting them to tasks that serve the goals of the Black Network but aren&rsquo;t necessarily criminal in nature. Agents of the Black Network must often work in secret, and are frequently proficient in Deception. They seek aid from the wizards, mercenaries, merchants and priesthoods allied with the <span>Zhentarim.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"line character margintop20 marginbottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>FEATURE: SAFE HAVEN</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As a faction agent, you have access to a secret network of supporters and operatives who can provide assistance on your adventures. You know a set of secret signs and passwords you can use to identify such operatives, who can provide you with access to a hidden safe house, free room and board, or assistance in finding information. These agents never risk their lives for you or risk revealing their true i<span>dentities.</span></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<div class=\"line character margintop20 marginbottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h5>Suggested Characteristics</h5>\r\n<p>Use the tables for the acolyte background below&nbsp;as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a faction agent.

The places discussed here are all sufficiently distant from the North and the Sword Coast to justify the use of this b<span>ackground.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Evermeet.</span></strong> The fabled elven islands far to the west are home to elves who have never been to Faer&ucirc;n. They often find it a harsher place than they expected when they do make the trip. If you are an elf, Evermeet is a logical (though not mandatory) choice for your<span> homeland.</span></p>\r\n<p>Most of those who emigrate from Evermeet are either exiles, forced out for committing some infraction of elven law, or emissaries who come to Faer&ucirc;n for a purpose that benefits elven culture o<span>r society.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Halruaa.</span></strong> Located on the southern edges of the Shining South, and hemmed in by mountains all around, the magocracy of Halruaa is a bizarre land to most in Faer&ucirc;n who know about it. Many folk have heard of the strange skyships the Halruaans sail, and a few know of the tales that even the least of their people can w<span>ork magic.</span></p>\r\n<p>Halruaans usually make their journeys into Faer&ucirc;n for personal reasons, since their government has a strict stance against unauthorized involvement with other nations and organizations. You might have been exiled for breaking one of Halruaa&rsquo;s many byzantine laws, or you could be a pilgrim who seeks the shrines of the gods<span> of magic.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Kara-Tur.</span></strong> The continent of Kara-Tur, far to the east of Faer&ucirc;n, is home to people whose customs are unfamiliar to the folk of the Sword Coast. If you come from Kara-Tur, the people of Faer&ucirc;n likely refer to you as Shou, even if that isn&rsquo;t your true ethnicity, because that&rsquo;s the blanket term they use for everyone who shares yo<span>ur origin.</span></p>\r\n<p>The folk of Kara-Tur occasionally travel to Faer&ucirc;n as diplomats or to forge trade relations with prosperous merchant cartels. You might have come here as part of some such delegation, then decided to stay when the mission<span> was over.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Mulhorand.</span></strong> From the terrain to the architecture to the god-kings who rule over these lands, nearly everything about Mulhorand is alien to someone from the Sword Coast. You likely experienced the same sort of culture shock when you left your desert home and traveled to the unfamiliar climes of northern Faer&ucirc;n. Recent events in your homeland have led to the abolition of slavery, and a corresponding increase in the traffic between Mulhorand and the distant parts <span>of Faer&ucirc;n.</span></p>\r\n<p>Those who leave behind Mulhorand&rsquo;s sweltering deserts and ancient pyramids for a glimpse at a different life do so for many reasons. You might be in the North simply to see the strangeness this wet land has to offer, or because you have made too many enemies among the desert communities of <span>your home.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Sossal.</span></strong> Few have heard of your homeland, but many have questions about it upon seeing you. Humans from Sossal seem crafted from snow, with alabaster skin and white hair, and typically dressed<span> in white.</span></p>\r\n<p>Sossal exists far to the northeast, hard up against the endless ice to the north and bounded on its other sides by hundreds of miles of the Great Glacier and the Great Ice Sea. No one from your nation makes the effort to cross such colossal barriers without a convincing reason. You must fear something truly terrible or seek something incredibly <span>important.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Zakhara.</span></strong> As the saying goes among those in Faer&ucirc;n who know of the place, &ldquo;To get to Zakhara, go south. Then go south some more.&rdquo; Of course, you followed an equally long route when you came north from your place of birth. Though it isn&rsquo;t unusual for Zakharans to visit the southern extremes of Faer&ucirc;n for trading purposes, few of them stray as far from home as<span> you have.</span></p>\r\n<p>You might be traveling to discover what wonders are to be found outside the deserts and sword-like mountains of your homeland, or perhaps you are on a pilgrimage to understand the gods that others worship, so that you might better appreciate your ow<span>n deities.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>The </span><span>Underdark.</span></strong> Though your home is physically closer to the Sword Coast than the other locations discussed here, it is far more unnatural. You hail from one of the settlements in the Underdark, each of which has its own strange customs and laws. If you are a native of one of the great subterranean cities or settlements, you are probably a member of the race that occupies the place&mdash;but you might also have grown up there after being captured and brought below when you wer<span>e a child.</span></p>\r\n<p>If you are a true Underdark native, you might have come to the surface as an emissary of your people, or perhaps to escape accusations of criminal behavior (whether warranted or not). If you aren&rsquo;t a native, your reason for leaving &ldquo;home&rdquo; probably has something to do with getting away from a bad <span>situation.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"line character margintop20 marginbottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<h5>Feature: All Eyes on You</h5>\r\n<p>Your accent, mannerisms, figures of speech, and perhaps even your appearance all mark you as foreign. Curious glances are directed your way wherever you go, which can be a nuisance, but you also gain the friendly interest of scholars and others intrigued by far-off lands, to say nothing of everyday folk who are eager to hear stories of your<span> homeland.</span></p>\r\n<p>You can parley this attention into access to people and places you might not otherwise have, for you and your traveling companions. Noble lords, scholars, and merchant princes, to name a few, might be interested in hearing about your distant homeland a<span>nd people.<br></span></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<h5 class=\"line character margintop20 marginbottom20\">&nbsp;Suggested Characteristics&nbsp;</h5>\r\n<table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>d6</th>\r\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Personality Trait</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>1</td>\r\n<td>I have different assumptions from those around me concerning personal space, blithely invading others&rsquo; space in innocence, or reacting to ignorant invasion of my own.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>2</td>\r\n<td>I have my own ideas about what is and is not food, and I find the eating habits of those around me fascinating, confusing, or revolting.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>3</td>\r\n<td>I have a strong code of honor or sense of propriety that others don&rsquo;t comprehend.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>4</td>\r\n<td>I express affection or contempt in ways that are unfamiliar to others.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>5</td>\r\n<td>I begin or end my day with small traditional rituals that are unfamiliar to those around me.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>6</td>\r\n<td>Sarcasm and insults are my weapons of choice.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>d6</th>\r\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Ideal</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>1</td>\r\n<td><span>Open.</span> I have much to learn from the kindly folk I meet along my way.

Other knightly orders serve a government, royal family, or are the elite military of a feudal state, such as the brutal Warlock Knights of Vaasa. Other knighthoods are secular and nongovernmental organizations of warriors who follow a particular philosophy, or consider themselves a kind of extended family, similar to an order of monks. Although there are organizations, such as the Knights of the Shield, that use the trappings of knighthood without necessarily being warriors, most folk of Faer&ucirc;n who hear the word &ldquo;knight&rdquo; think of a mounted warrior in armor beholden to a code. Below are a few knightly orga<span>nizations.</span> <br><strong><span>Knights of the Unicorn.</span> </strong></span><span>The Knights of the Unicorn began as a fad of romantically minded sons and daughters of patriar families in Baldur&rsquo;s Gate. On a lark, they took the unicorn goddess Lurue as their mascot and went on various adventures for fun. The reality of the dangers they faced eventually sank in, as did Lurue&rsquo;s tenets. Over time the small group grew and spread, gaining a following in places as far as Cormyr. The Knights of the Unicorn are chivalric adventurers who follow romantic ideals: life is to be relished and lived with laughter, quests should be taken on a dare, impossible dreams should be pursued for the sheer wonder of their completion, and everyone should be praised for their strengths and comforted in their w<span>eaknesses.</span> <br><strong><span>Knights of Myth Drannor.</span></strong> Long ago, the Knights of Myth Drannor were a famous adventuring band, and Dove Falconhand, one of the famous Seven Sisters, was one of them. The band took its name to honor the great but fallen city, just as the new Knights of Myth Drannor do today. With the city once again in ruins, Dove Falconhand decided to reform the group with the primary goal of building alliances and friendship between the civilized races of the world and goodly people in order to combat evil. The Knights of Myth Drannor once again ride the roads of the Dalelands, and they&rsquo;ve begun to spread to the lands beyond. Their members, each accepted by Dove herself, are above all valiant a<span>nd honest.</span> <br><strong><span>Knights of the Silver Chalice.</span></strong> The Knights of the Silver Chalice was formed by edict of the demigod Siamorphe in Waterdeep a century ago. Siamorphe&rsquo;s ethos is the nobility&rsquo;s right and responsibility to rule, and the demigod is incarnated as a different noble mortal in each generation. By the decree of the Siamorphe at that time, the Knights of the Silver Chalice took it upon themselves to put a proper heir on the throne of Tethyr and reestablish order in that kingdom. Since then they have grown to be the most popular knighthood in Tethyr, a nation that has hosted many knighthoods in fealty to <span>the crown.</span></span></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<div class=\"line character margintop20 marginbottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p><strong><span>Skill Proficiencies:</span></strong>&nbsp;Persuasion, plus one from among Arcana, History, Nature, and Religion, as appropriate for <span>your order<br></span><strong><span>Tool Proficiencies:</span></strong> One type of gaming set or musical <span>instrument<br></span><strong><span>Languages:</span></strong> One of y<span>our choice<br></span><strong><span>Equipment:</span></strong> One set of traveler&rsquo;s clothes, a signet, banner or seal representing your place or rank in the order, and a pouch contai<span>ning 10 gp</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"line character margintop20 marginbottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>FEATURE: KNIGHTLY REGARD</strong></p>\r\n<p>You receive shelter and succor from members of your knightly order and those who are sympathetic to its aims.

The goals and philosophies of the order are more important than the gear and fighting style of its members, and so most of these orders aren&rsquo;t limited to fighting types, but are open to all sorts of folk who are willing to battle and die for the orde<span>r&rsquo;s cause.</span></p>\r\n<p>The &ldquo;Knightly Orders of Faer&ucirc;n&rdquo; sidebar details several of the orders that are active at present and is designed to help inform your decision about which group you owe alle<span>giance to.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"line character margintop20 marginbottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><span><strong>KNIGHTLY ORDERS OF&nbsp;<strong>FAER&Ucirc;N</strong></strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span>Many who rightfully call themselves &ldquo;knight&rdquo; earn that title as part of an order in service to a deity, such as Kelemvor&rsquo;s Eternal Order or Mystra&rsquo;s Knights of the Mystic Fire. Other knightly orders serve a government, royal family, or are the elite military of a feudal state, such as the brutal Warlock Knights of Vaasa. Other knighthoods are secular and nongovernmental organizations of warriors who follow a particular philosophy, or consider themselves a kind of extended family, similar to an order of monks. Although there are organizations, such as the Knights of the Shield, that use the trappings of knighthood without necessarily being warriors, most folk of Faer&ucirc;n who hear the word &ldquo;knight&rdquo; think of a mounted warrior in armor beholden to a code. Below are a few knightly orga<span>nizations.</span>&nbsp;<br><strong><span>Knights of the Unicorn.</span>&nbsp;</strong></span><span>The Knights of the Unicorn began as a fad of romantically minded sons and daughters of patriar families in Baldur&rsquo;s Gate. On a lark, they took the unicorn goddess Lurue as their mascot and went on various adventures for fun. The reality of the dangers they faced eventually sank in, as did Lurue&rsquo;s tenets. Over time the small group grew and spread, gaining a following in places as far as Cormyr. The Knights of the Unicorn are chivalric adventurers who follow romantic ideals: life is to be relished and lived with laughter, quests should be taken on a dare, impossible dreams should be pursued for the sheer wonder of their completion, and everyone should be praised for their strengths and comforted in their w<span>eaknesses.</span>&nbsp;<br><strong><span>Knights of Myth Drannor.</span></strong>&nbsp;Long ago, the Knights of Myth Drannor were a famous adventuring band, and Dove Falconhand, one of the famous Seven Sisters, was one of them. The band took its name to honor the great but fallen city, just as the new Knights of Myth Drannor do today. With the city once again in ruins, Dove Falconhand decided to reform the group with the primary goal of building alliances and friendship between the civilized races of the world and goodly people in order to combat evil. The Knights of Myth Drannor once again ride the roads of the Dalelands, and they&rsquo;ve begun to spread to the lands beyond. Their members, each accepted by Dove herself, are above all valiant a<span>nd honest.</span>&nbsp;<br><strong><span>Knights of the Silver Chalice.</span></strong>&nbsp;The Knights of the Silver Chalice was formed by edict of the demigod Siamorphe in Waterdeep a century ago. Siamorphe&rsquo;s ethos is the nobility&rsquo;s right and responsibility to rule, and the demigod is incarnated as a different noble mortal in each generation. By the decree of the Siamorphe at that time, the Knights of the Silver Chalice took it upon themselves to put a proper heir on the throne of Tethyr and reestablish order in that kingdom. Since then they have grown to be the most popular knighthood in Tethyr, a nation that has hosted many knighthoods in fealty to&nbsp;<span>the crown.</span></span></p>\r\n</blockquote>","skillProficienciesDescription":"Persuasion, plus one from among Arcana, History, Nature, and Religion, as appropriate for your order","toolProficienciesDescription":"One type of gaming set or musical instrument","languagesDescription":"One of your choice","equipmentDescription":"One set of traveler&rsquo;s clothes, a signet, banner or seal representing your place or rank in the order, and a pouch containing 10 gp","featureName":"Knightly Regard","featureDescription":"<p>You receive shelter and succor from members of your knightly order and those who are sympathetic to its aims.

Perhaps this is why Uthgar chose to raise up the totems among the people as living embodiments of his power. Perhaps they needed a reminder of who they were and from whence they came.
